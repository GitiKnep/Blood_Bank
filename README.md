## Blood Bank

**
The blood bank project was established in order to facilitate the blood bank system.
There are three personalities on this site: 

 1. sicks
 2. donors
 3. donations.

The site organizes the system of donations to the blood bank so that a patient who needs a donation is **added** to the system and a donation entity is opened for him.
The system will match a donor to a patient according to blood type and will display optional donations.
A patient who has recovered is **deleted** from the system as well as donors who contributed, or donations that were made.
The system also **updates** data such as donation status and the like.
